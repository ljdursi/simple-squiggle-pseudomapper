# Simple Squiggle Pseudomapper
Simple demonstration of using spatial indexes (here kd-trees) to 
approximately map nanopore squiggle reads.

Running the `index_and_map.sh` script provides a quick demonstration,
indexing the reference sequence of an ecoli strain and approximately 
mapping 10 reads of older and newer nanopore reads to the reference.
